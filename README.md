BIKE Weak Key Recovery Attack
---

This repo was released to provide supplementary material for the paper __Efficient Weak Key Recovery for QC-MDPC Codes like BIKE__

In [bike-attack-code](bike-attack-code/README.md) code for collecting traces, generating distance spectra images, and ML Valley detection can be found. Code for the ISD and key recvoery may follow at a later point in time.
In [fault-injection](fault-injection/README.md) the code for the FI on STM32F415 can be found.
In [paper_figures](paper_figures/README.md) vectorized versions of the images from the paper can be found.
